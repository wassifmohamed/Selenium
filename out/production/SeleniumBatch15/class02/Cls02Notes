there are some important things that you should remember while selecting a locator...

if a attribute value has a number in  it , it is better to avoid it and use an alternative locator !!!


difference in linkText and partial link Text ?
a partial link text you can use just a part , just make sure that it is Unique enough to stand out.






-------------------------
what  did we learn today ??
 Locators :
      locator sin Selenium help us to fin dWebElements

      8 locators

      id , name, className

      Linktext , partialLinktext (they can only be used for <A> and it must also have some Text )
      TagName (we just need to pass the tagname and it is going find that partcular webElement)

      DOM document object model

      Scenario :
